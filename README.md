# Unit4-Game-App
I made three main updates to the CSS 
-Changing the font used to Didot (updated directly in the styles.css file) & Updated the background color of main container
-The game over message's background is animated with different colors depending on whether or not the user wins or loses. I updated the styles.css file directly here as well.
-Each time the player guesses incorrectly the background color of the main container decreases slightly in brightness
